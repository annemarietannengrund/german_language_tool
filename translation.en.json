  "about_page_paragraph_1": "This program is intended to teach and for practice the german numbers.",
  "about_page_paragraph_2": "The examples include spelling, pronunciation, intonation, and notes about special rules or cases that may apply.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_1": "The two-digit numbers from 13 to 19 do not use the connecting word \"__UUNNDD__\", but from 20 to 99 it is always present.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_2": "This means that you can use the numbers from the lesson before (The numbers from 1-9).",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_3": "In german, the two digit part of a number is said from the left to the right, this is very important! On the whole tenth (20, 40,50,60,70,80, 90) you append a -zig at the end.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_4": "In the two-digit parts from 21-99 first say the number from the left, in case of 42 you start with the 2.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_5": "You now have to connect the 2 and 40 by the connecting word \"__UUNNDD__\". e.g. __ZWEI__-__UUNNDD__-__VIER__-zig",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_6": "Its best to train with the whole tenth numbers, because they are always the suffix of every number in between x1-x9.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_7": "This however does not apply to __DREISZIG__, Why does 30 end with -__SZ__ig instead of -zig.",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_8": "The reason for this \"inconsistency\" in the tens range goes far back in the history of the German language, because it can be explained with the so-called High German or second sound shift in the early Middle Ages. We would like to quote the »Dictionary of Linguistic Doubts« by Dudenverlag (Mannheim 2016), which explains the reasons very clearly:",
  "numbers_with_two_digits_paragraph_9": "\"The reason why thirty is written with ß, but the other tens with z (twenty, ninety), is this: the tens are formed by adding the suffix -zig, which goes back to a Germanic word beginning with t (cf . got .tigus = ›decade, ten‹) In the combinations of basic numbers as the first element and this word as the second element, the initial t usually comes after a consonant (twenty-, four-, five-, etc.) and was then loud phonetic laws in High German sound shift (6th-8th century AD) to a stop followed by a fricative ([ts] = z. This does not occur between vowels, here t was shifted into a fricative, a sharp s ([s] = ß), i.e.: __DREI__-ß-ig.« And so this exception has survived to this day.\""
